        One of my favorite things—besides sports and gaming—is simply enjoying life’s comfort activities:
        eating good food, scrolling through social media, and watching YouTube videos, shows, and movies.
        I like trying all kinds of foods, especially anything spicy, even though there are certain ingredients
        I avoid. Outside of that, I’m always drawn to the sky as an aesthetic; sunsets, clouds, and late-night
        skies just give me a feeling of peace. I love spending time with my family, friends, and my girlfriend
        , because those moments always feel like the ones that matter the most. My music taste is all over
        the place in the best way, from chill tracks to hype playlists—here’s my Spotify if you want to
        see what I’m into: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1Y8C8D0951UGgCMOxVRG3v?si=s1rsrZ5UQsOme1tKZglvwg">Spotify</a>. And honestly, nothing beats
        wearing lazy, comfy clothing; it just matches my whole vibe perfectly. And lastly you can see a lot
        of aspects colored blue, which is in fact my favorite color.

        <p> My love for volleyball started with the anime Haikyuu!!, which sparked my interest 
          in the sport and from there it grew. I was a part of a little tournament in high school
          for fun with my girlfriend which led me to start going to some open gyms.
          My girlfriend was already playing seriously, so I wanted to get better and spend more time with her.
          Volleyball quickly became the sport I spent the most time on, whether at school, at local gyms, or practicing with friends. 
          My brother and I even started a YouTube channel where we document the open gyms 
          we attend, sharing tips, highlights, and our favorite moments. </p>

        <h3>The is my life in Football</h3>
        <img id="football" src="Pictures/Football.gif">
        <p>I always wanted to play more football, but the only organized experience I had was in middle school.
           Even though I didn’t continue playing competitively, I still love tossing the ball around with friends
            and watching games. Growing up in Washington, I became a dedicated Seahawks fan and thankfully was able
            to watch them win the Super Bowl in 2014, I still watch the NFL, but now with Fantasy Football, I enjoy
            watching the players I have more now. </p>

        <h4> The is my life in Basketball</h4>
        <img id="basketball" src="Pictures/Basketball.gif">
        <p>
          I grew up playing basketball and have been around the sport my entire life. Most
           of my experiences were casual, just shooting hoops with friends or playing at 
           school, though I did play for a middle school club team once. Even now that I’m
            out of school, I still enjoy playing occasionally just for fun. My favorite player
             is LeBron James, so I naturally follow whatever team he’s on, cheering for 
             him no matter where he plays. Basketball has always been a big part of my life
             , and it’s a sport I enjoy both playing and watching.
